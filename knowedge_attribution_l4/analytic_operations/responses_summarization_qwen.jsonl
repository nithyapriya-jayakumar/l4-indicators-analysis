Start with the main idea: quantum sensing uses quantum properties for sensitivity. Then mention applications. Compare with classical sensors and the need for environmental control. Then talk about miniaturization and integration into portable devices. Finally, mention the role of materials science and future expansion into commercial areas, plus ongoing research on stability and complexity. Make sure each sentence is concise and sticks to the article's points without adding anything. Check for sentence count. Let me try to structure that.\n</think>\n\nQuantum sensing leverages quantum properties like superposition and entanglement to achieve highly sensitive measurements of physical quantities. It enables applications such as detecting weak magnetic fields, improving navigation systems, and advancing medical imaging. While quantum sensors often surpass classical devices, they require strict environmental control to avoid decoherence.

{"id": "S040", "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants a summary of the article in 3-5 sentences without adding extra facts. The article talks about low-code development platforms. First, I need to identify the main points.\n\nThe article starts by explaining what low-code platforms are: they let people with limited programming skills build apps using graphical interfaces and reusable components. Then it mentions why businesses use them—speeding up development and reducing reliance on engineers. Next, integration capabilities with databases, APIs, and enterprise systems are highlighted. Then there are concerns: scalability, vendor lock-in, and security in fast-developed apps. The article also says organizations need governance frameworks. Finally, it concludes that as tools improve, low-code will be more important in digital transformation.\n\nI need to condense all that into 3-5 sentences. Let me check each sentence to make sure I don't add anything. Start with the definition and purpose. Then the integration part. Then the concerns. Then governance. Finally, the future role. Let me make sure each sentence is concise and captures the key points without extra info. Avoid technical jargon where possible. Make sure it's all from the original article. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nLow-code development platforms enable users with minimal programming skills to create applications using visual interfaces and pre-built components, helping businesses accelerate development and reduce dependency on specialized engineers. These platforms integrate with databases, APIs, and enterprise systems but face challenges like scalability issues, vendor lock-in, and security risks in rapidly developed apps. Organizations must implement governance frameworks to manage these tools responsibly.
